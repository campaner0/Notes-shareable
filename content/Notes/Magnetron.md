[[Microwaves]]
- High voltage applied across anode, cathode cause cathode to emit e-
- magnets on top, bottom create [[Magnetic Field]] perp to [[Electric Field]] between electrodes
	- causes e- path to bend as shown
- e- movement near resonating cavities produce microwaves (similar to flute)
	- magnetrons usually tuned to 2.45 GHz
- microwaves travel down waveguide into oven, bounce around, hit food 
	- polar water molecules align with wave (alignment changes at 2.45 GHz)
	- movement makes friction, heat
	- non polar molecules e- cloud aligns, but creates insignificant heat - reason for micro safe materials
