Friction is a [[Force]] perpendicular to the [[Normal Force]] and parallel to the plane where the two objects meet. It opposes motion along this plane.

In the case of an object moving along an inclined plane:
$$
\vec{F}_{FR}=mg\sin\theta
$$
where $\theta$ is the angle of slope the object moves along

### Coefficient of Friction
This can be either static ($\mu_s$) or kinetic ($\mu_k$) depending on whether the objects are at rest or one is moving along the other's surface, respectively. The kinetic coeff. is almost always lower than the static coeff.

In the case of an object moving along an inclined plane, $\mu$ can be calculated:
$$
\mu=\tan\theta
$$
where $\theta$ is the angle of slope the object moves along
