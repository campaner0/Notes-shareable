The voltage divider rule is used to calculate the voltage across a component in a resistive series circuit.

### DC
$$
V_k=\left(\frac{R_k}{R_{EQ}}\right)V_s
$$
where
- $V_k$ = [[Voltage]] across target resistor
- $R_k$ = [[Resistance]] value of target
- $R_{EQ}$ = equivalent resistance for circuit

---

### AC
This rule works for [[Alternating Current]]  phasors when in the frequency domain:
$$
\vec{V_k}=\frac{\vec Z_k}{\vec Z_{eq}}\vec{V}
$$
where
- $\vec Z$ = [[Impedance]]
