## Input Impedance
Input [[Impedance]] of a circuit determines how much of the applied [[Voltage]] and [[Current]] "reaches" the circuit and is used in it. A high input impedance means the voltage drop across the circuit will be high, meaning more voltage is applied to the circuit as opposed to later elements. The opposite is true for current. This is the concept of a [[Voltage Divider Rule|Voltage Divider]].  

The input impedance of a circuit can be found by using a known test voltage and current:
$$
Z_{in}= \frac{V_{test}}{I_{test}}
$$

## Output Impedance
Output impedance is basically the opposite of input impedance. The same rules apply such that high output impedance will apply the most voltage to the output of the circuit and vice versa for current.
