The row space of a $n\times m$ [[Matrix]] $A$ is the [[Span]] of the row [[Vector|Vectors]] of $A$. The row space is a [[Vector Subspace]] of $\mathbb{R}^n$. 

>[!note]
>If $A\sim B$ and $B$ is in [[Echelon Form]], the nonzero rows of $B$ form the basis for the row spaces of $A$ and $B$

\text{Row}(A)=\text{Col}(A^T)
