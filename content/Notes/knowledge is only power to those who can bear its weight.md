Sometimes knowledge can destroy someone if it is heavy enough. The realization that the world is not as it seemed can be destructive psychologically if it involves a significant perspective shift regarding the view of self or ones place in the world. If information can pull the rug out from under the jenga tower of ones worldview, it is likely to be rejected in one way or another as a defense mechanism. Therefore, the ones who can effectivly put a piece of information to use are those who can accomodate the new info and integrate it successfully into their mind. 

There is also the danger of knowing something that makes another feel threatened enough to take action to ensure the knowledge does not spread, eg. blackmail, threats, kidnapping, even murder. 

The ability to believe and act on information is prerequisite to empowerment by it.
