  #parapsychology

In parapsychology, psi (from the Greek letter $\psi$) is the factor of paranormal psychological experiences such as [[Extrasensory Perception]] and [[Psychokinesis]] that is not explained by known physical or biological mechanisms. These are divided into psi-gamma and psi-kappa, indicating those events incoming and outgoing from the mind, respectively.
