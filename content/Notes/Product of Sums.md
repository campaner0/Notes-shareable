In [[Boolean Algebra]], a product of sums occurs when an expression is arranged such that within each term the variables are summed and each term is multiplied:
$$
F=(A+B+C)(\bar{A+B+C})\cdots(\bar{A}+\bar{B}+\bar{C})
$$
The terms may have two or more variables, and there is no limit to the number of terms or variables.

Not to be confused with a [[Sum of Products]]
