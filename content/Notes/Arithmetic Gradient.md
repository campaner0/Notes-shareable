In an arithmetic gradient, cash flow changes by the same amount each year, as opposed to a percentage like a [[Geometric Gradient]]. That is, the difference between consecutive terms is the same. It may start at a base amount which may be different than the gradient amount.

To convert to [[Annual Payments|A]]:
$$
A=\text{base}\pm G(A/G,i,n)
$$
where
- $\text{base}$ = amount in [[Time]] period 1
- $G$ = gradient
- $i$ = [[Interest and Interest Rate|Interest]]
- $n$ = number of applicable periods 

>[!note]
>Use plus or minus depending on if the gradient is increasing or decreasing
