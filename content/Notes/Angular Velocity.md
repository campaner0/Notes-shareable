Also known as angular frequency, angular velocity is the rotational equivalent to frequency.
$$
\omega=2\pi f
$$
where
- $\omega$ = angular frequency
- $f$ = [[Frequency]]


## Units
In a mechanical context, angular velocity may be expressed in units of radians per second or revolutions per minute/second. The $m$ subscript indicates a mechanical quantity:
- $\omega_m$ = rad/s
- $f_m$ = revolutions/s
- $n_m$ = rpm

To convert between units:
$$\begin{align*}
n_{m}&= 60f_m\\[5pt]
f_{m}&= \frac{\omega_{m}}{2\pi}
\end{align*}$$
