Not to be confused with the [[Voltage|Electromotive Force]] or [[Electromagnetic Force]], the magnetomotive force is the equivalent of [[Voltage]] in a [[Magnetic Circuits|Magnetic Circuit]]. Units: Ampere Turns

This force has polarity: positive on the side where the magnetic flux exits, and negative where it enters. For a coil, the direction of force is perpendicular to the plane of the coil. It can be found using flux and reluctance or current and turns in a [[Transformer]]:
$$\begin{align*}
\mathcal{F}&= \Phi\mathcal{R}\\
&= Ni
\end{align*}$$
where
- $\Phi$ = [[Magnetic Flux]]
- $\mathcal{R}$ = [[Magnetic Reluctance]]
- $N$ = number of turns in coil
- $i$ = [[Current]]
