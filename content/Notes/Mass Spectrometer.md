  #Physics 

Identifies mass of atom, molecule
1. charge enters [[Velocity Selector]]
2. [[Electric Field]] ends, mag remains
3. Charge begins [[Circular Motion]] with radius $r$:
$$
r=\frac{mv}{qB}
$$
where
- $m$ = [[Mass]]
- $v$ = [[Velocity]]
- $q$ = [[Charge]]
- $B$ = [[Magnetic Field]]

Since radius is dependent on the ratio of mass and charge, it can be used to calculate the charge's mass:
$$
\frac mq=\frac{rB}{v}
$$
