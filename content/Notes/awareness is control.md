When it comes to internal matters, control over one's actions and thoughts can only be achieved if one is aware that they are happening. If someone is craving junk food, distraction from the craving often leads to giving in. A better strategy is to pay [[attention]] to how you are feeling and why you feel this way. As more attention is given, understanding increases and the craving's power is diminished. 

This agrees with the notion that [[you will become what you hate about yourself]] since the natural reaction to unwanted thoughts or feelings is to avoid them. By distraction or suppression of some form, this aspect of the self grows more powerful. Jung's approach to [[The Shadow]] was to approach it with curiosity rather than judgement, fear, or anger. Its about building self-awareness and making the unconscious conscious.

One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious. (_The Collected Works of Carl Jung_, Vol. 13, Page 335)
