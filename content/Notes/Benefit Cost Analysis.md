Benefit cost analysis is used mostly by the public sector and non-profits. These projects are generally longer term and funded by taxes, bonds, and fees. They are politically driven rather than economically driven.


## B/C Ratio
The benefit/cost ratio indicates if the project is economically justified. If $B/C\ge 1$, the project is justified. There are two possible formulas, conventional and modified, but both will give the same result on whether or not to invest though the number may be different.

$$\begin{align*}
\text{Conventional Ratio} &= \frac{B-D}{I}\\[5pt]
\text{Modified Ratio} &= \frac{B-D-O\&M}{I}
\end{align*}$$
These formulas can be calculated using [[Present Worth Analysis|PW]] or [[Annual Worth Analysis|AW]]:
$$\begin{array}{c|c}
\text{Conventional} & \text{Modified}\\
\hline
\frac{PW(B)}{I-PW(MV)+PW(O\&M)} & \frac{PW(B)-PW(O\&M)}{I-PW(MV)}\\
\frac{AW(B)}{CR-AW(MV)+AW(O\&M)} & \frac{AW(B)-AW(O\&M)}{CR-AW(MV)}
\end{array}$$
where
- $B$ = benefits
- $D$ = disbenefits
- $I$ = initial investment by government
- $MV$ = market value ([[Salvage Value]])
- $O\&M$ = operation and maintenance
- $CR$ = capitalized cost/initial cost annuitized
