  #Antennas #Electromagnetics 

An antenna is a [[Transducer]] that converts a wave propagating on a [[Transmission Lines|Transmission Line]] into an [[Electromagnetic Wave]] propagating in free space (or some other unbounded medium) and vice versa. 

types
- Isotropic
	- hypothetical antenna w/ spherical radiation pattern
- [[Hertzian Dipole]]
	- very short
	- length does not exceed $\lambda/50$ 
- biconical dipole
	- wider bandwidth
- loop
	- biomedical applications
- circular plate reflector
- log-periodic
- parabolic dish
- horn
- microstrip
- antenna array
- Yagi

near vs far-field propagation
- near field
	- wave appears circular
- far field
	- planar
- difference due to increasing radius of spherical transmission
