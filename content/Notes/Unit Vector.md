A unit vector is a [[Vector]] with [[Magnitude]] 1. The most basic are the standard unit vectors $\hat{i}, \hat j,\hat k$ (or $\hat x, \hat y, \hat z$) which point in the positive x, y, and z directions. Unit vectors are denoted with the hat mark.

To calculate the unit vector in the direction of some vector $\vec u$, divide the vector by its magnitude or take the cosine of the angles between the vector and each axis:
$$
\hat{u}=\frac{\vec u}{|\vec u|}=(\cos\alpha,\cos\beta,\cos\gamma)
$$
where
- $\alpha$ = [[Angle]] to x axis
- $\beta$ = angle to y axis
- $\gamma$ = angle to z axis

From this: $\alpha=\cos^{-1}(v_1/|\vec v|)$ and similar for $\beta$ and $\gamma$
