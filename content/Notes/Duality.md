Duality is a principle of math where a [[Function]] corresponds [[1-1 Functions|1 to 1]] with its dual such that a function is often the inverse of its dual.

### Boolean Algebra
In [[Boolean Algebra]], the dual of an expression is found by interchanging AND and OR operators. 1's and 0's are also flipped. 

Ex:
[[Consensus Theorem]] and [[Dual of the Consensus Theorem]]
[[Sum of Products]] and [[Product of Sums]]
