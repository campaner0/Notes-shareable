  #Control_Systems

Control systems are used, as the name implies, to electrically control a system of objects to achieve a task. These come in open or closed loop varieties, depending on if feedback is used. Each component in the system is modeled by its [[Transfer Function]], which acts on the input to transform it into the output. By editing the components, the transfer functions can be changed to achieve a desired output.

Four inputs are commonly used:
1. [[Step Function]]
2. [[Ramp Function]]
3. [[Unit Impulse Function|Impulse Function]]
4. Sinusoidal
