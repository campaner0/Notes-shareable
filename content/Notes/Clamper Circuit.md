  #Circuit_Analysis 

A clamper circuit limits the maximum output [[Voltage]] of an [[Alternating Current|AC]] signal. If the signal's peak exceeds the an arbitrary voltage, the signal is shifted "down" so that the peak is no longer greater than that voltage. The wave is essentially given a negative DC offset.
