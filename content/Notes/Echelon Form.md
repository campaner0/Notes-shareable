A [[Matrix]] is in echelon form when:
1. All non-zero rows are above all rows of zeros
2. Each leading entry of a row is in a column which is to the right of the leading entry above it
3. All entries in a row before the leading entry are zeros 

>[!example]
$$
\begin{bmatrix}3&2&0&7 \\ 0&1&4&4 \\ 0&0&5&2 \\ 0&0&0&0\end{bmatrix}
$$

A matrix in echelon form can be reduced to [[Row Reduced Echelon Form]].
