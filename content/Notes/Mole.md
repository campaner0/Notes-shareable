The mole is the unit of measurement for amount of substance. One mole has Avogadro's number of elementary entities (atoms, molecules, etc.) within it. The Avogadro constant is used to denote this and to convert between the average [[Mass]] of one particle in g and the molar mass of the substance in g/mol.
$$
N_{A}=6.02214076\times 10^{23}\,\text{mol}^{-1}
$$
where
- $N_A$ = Avogadro constant
