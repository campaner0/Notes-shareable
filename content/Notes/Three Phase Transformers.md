Three phase transformers are regular transformers but are used for three phases of [[Electrical Power]]. They come in two forms: three cores and three pairs of windings for each phase or all three phases sharing one core. For the separate phase transformers, each phase can be switched out individually if needed, while with the single core transformer, the whole core must be replaced if one phase has a problem. However, the single core has the advantage in price, weight, and efficiency.
