[[unpredictability is the result of chaotic systems]], and life is lived in nature, a chaotic system of chaotic systems. Trying to control an outcome or impose one's own (or other's) assumptions of how things should be will only result in disappointment and frustration. I think this is why people who go with the flow seem to be happier, why Mom is constantly irked by the dog, Charlotte. She tries to control the dog's behavior by brute force, trying to align the dog's behavior with her own will. I think a better approach would be to find the dog's incentives and use them to change her behavior. [[it is much easier to work with nature than against it]]. [[we can control our actions, but not their outcomes]]

>[!note] From Vector Synthesis:
>Steina concurs with Woody that there "is a danger of being infatuated with an 'idea' and then trying to impose it on the material" when in fact the materiality of a medium such as audio/visual feedback defies such a top-down approach and only becomes rewarding when "you can drop all preconceptions" and "end up with something completely different from what you intended to do." 

Giovanni Giorgio in Daft Punk's song [[Giorgio by Moroder]] said nobody told him what to do and he dropped all preconceived notions of music being correct, then he was free to do what he wanted. Interestingly, he was working with the Moog module, which Holzer also mentions as being an important device in the early creation of computer art.
