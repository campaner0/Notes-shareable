A causal system is one whose value at any time depends only on past and present inputs. If a system depends on past, present, and future values, it is acausal or non-causal. A system whose values at any time depend only on future inputs is anticausal. 

Causal signals will only have values in the first and fourth quadrents of the xy plane, and anticausal signals will only be in the second and third. Acausal signals may be in all quadrents.
