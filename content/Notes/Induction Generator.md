If an [[Induction Motor]]'s rotor is driven faster than $n_{sync}$, the motor begins to function as a generator. This type of generator cannot produce reactive [[Electrical Power|Power]] due to its lack of field [[Current]], so this must be supplied externally. This separate reactive power source must also regulate the terminal [[Voltage]] of the generator.
