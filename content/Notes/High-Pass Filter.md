A high-pass filter will [[Filters|Filter]] out frequencies below the corner [[Frequency]].

## First Order
A passive high-pass filter is constructed out of a [[RC Circuits|RC Circuit]]:

Its transfer function is given by:
$$
H(s)=\frac{sRC}{1+sRC}
$$
with a corner [[Frequency]] of
$$
\omega= \frac{1}{RC}
$$
