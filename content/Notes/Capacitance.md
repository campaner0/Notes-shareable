Capacitance is the ratio of [[Charge]] on a conductor to the difference in [[Voltage|Electric Potential]], either between conductor/enviroment (self) or conductor/conductor (mutual). 
$$
C=\frac{Q}{\Delta{V}}
$$
where
- $C$ = capacitance (F)
- $Q$ = charge (C)
- $\Delta{V}$ = electric potential (V)

To calculate capacitance:
1. Calculate [[Electric Field]] between conductors
2. Determine [[Voltage]] from $\vec{E}$
3. Use above equation

From this, a capacitor with two parallel, equally sized plates has capacitance:
$$
C=\frac{A\varepsilon_r}{d}
$$
where
- $A$ = [[Area]] of plates
- $\varepsilon_r$ = [[Permittivity]] of dielectric
- $d$ = [[Distance]] between plates
A spherical cap (one sphere in another) has capacitance:
$$
C=\frac{ab}{k_e(b-a)}
$$
where
- $a$ and $b$ are radii of inner and outer spheres
- $k_e$ = Coulomb's constant (see [[Electromagnetic Force]])

### Energy Stored by a Capacitor
Expressed by:
$$
U_E=\frac{Q^2}{2C}
$$
Energy density is found by dividing by volume:
$$
u_E=\frac{U_E}V=\frac 12\varepsilon_0E^2
$$
