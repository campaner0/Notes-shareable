The P-N junction diode is a semiconductor device that consists of one [[P-N Junction]] with two terminals. It serves to only alow current to flow in one direction.

## Peak Inverse Voltage
Peak inverse voltage is the maximum reverse bias a diode will experience in a circuit. In a halfwave rectifier, this will be $-V_{in}$.
