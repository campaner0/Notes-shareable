A [[Function]] is one-to-one (1-1), or injective, if for every possible output there is at most one corresponding input. That is, the function maps distinct inputs to distinct outputs. This implies:
$$
\forall\,a,b\in X,\;f(a)=f(b)\Rightarrow a=b
$$
where $X$ is the [[Domain]] of a function $f$.

### 1-1 Transformations
A transformation $T:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m$ is one-to-one if $\forall\,b\in \mathbb{R}^m, \exists$ at most one $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $T(x)=b$. Where $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the [[Domain]] of $T$ and $\mathbb{R}^m$ is its [[Codomain]].
