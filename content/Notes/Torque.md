Also known as Moment, torque is essentially rotational [[Force]]. Just as force produces change in the linear motion of an object, torque produces change in the [[Circular Motion]] of an object. Similarly to force, the integral of torque is [[Work]], and its derivative is [[Angular Momentum]]. (Units: Newton Meters: $N\cdot m$)

It is calculated with the [[Cross Product]] of the position and force vectors:
$$
\vec{\tau}=\vec{r}\times\vec{F}
$$
where
- $\vec{r}$ = [[Position]] vector, from axis to line of action (where force is being applied)
- $\vec{F}$ = force [[Vector]]

In 2d, $\tau = Fd$, where $d$ is the distance from the axis to line of action.

Torque can also be defined as the product of [[Moment of Inertia]] and [[Angular Acceleration]]:
$$
\vec{\tau}=I\vec{\alpha}
$$
This is similar to how force is defined in [[Newton's Second Law]]
