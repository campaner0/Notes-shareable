Nonlinear circuit analysis is the analysis of circuits with nonlinear elements such as [[Diode|Diodes]], transistors, and op amps. Each element has one or more models that may describe its behavior under certain circumstances. These models are used to define the circuit in linear elements for analysis:

### Step 1: Choose a Model
Choose a model that most fits the current circuit situation.


### Step 2: Rewrite Circuit w/ Linear Elements



### Step 3: Analyse



### Step 4: Check Answer
