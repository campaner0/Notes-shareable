RAM, or random access memory, is memory which can be accessed at any location within memory at the same speed, as opposed to [[Serial Memory]]. It can be written to or read from and reset, but does not hold memory after a power loss, as opposed to [[ROM]]. RAM can be either SRAM or DRAM.

### SRAM
SRAM, or static RAM, uses [[SR Latch|Latches]] to store information and has shorter read/write times.

### DRAM
DRAM, or dynamic RAM, stores info using charged [[Capacitance|Capacitors]]. It uses less power and has larger capacity per chip since one memory cell is just one capacitor and one transistor.
