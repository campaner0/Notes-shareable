- 400 BC: Democritus forms concept of atom, called Atomos meaning indivisible
	- smallest possible piece of matter
- 1897: Plum Pudding, J.J. Thomson, positive substrate with [[Electron|e-]] scattered within
	- [[Cathode Ray Tube]] experiments
	- e- [[Mass]] found to be ~1000x smaller than H$^+$ ion
	- e- charge found to be negative
- 1911: Ernest Rutherford model, mass concentrated in nucleus
	- $\alpha$ particles projected at gold foil
	- some deflected by foil instead of passing through indicating mass at center of atom
		- concept of nucleus w/ orbiting e- developed
	- conflicted with classical mechanics, e- should emit light if accelerating around nucleus, losing [[Energy]] and spiraling toward nucleus
	- unstable
- 1913: [[Bohr Model]] e- can only orbit at certain energy levels, can jump between
	- quantized energy levels, farther from nucleus = higher energy
	- $\Delta E=hv$, where $\Delta E$ is the difference in energy between lvls
	- e- jump to higher levels when energized, then drops to lower emitting energy as light
	- only modeled hydrogen successfully
- [[Quantum Mechanical Model]]:
	- e- cloud, areas of higher, lower prob of finding e-
	- s, p, d, f orbitals, each diff shape
	- shell model
		- n - principal quantum number, shell number, n = 1, 2, 3, …
			- max number of e- $N_{e}=2n^2$
		- $\ell$ - [[Angular Momentum]] quantum number, subshell number $\ell$ = 0, 1, 2, 3, … 
			- max number of e- in subshell $N_{e}=2(2\ell+1)$ 
	- e- config (fills left to right, top to bottom):
$$\begin{array}{c}
\qquad\qquad\quad\text{Subshell}\\
\begin{array}{cc|cccc}
& & \ell=0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\
n & \text{Shell} & s & p & d & f \\
\hline
1 & K & 2 \\
2 & L & 2 & 6 \\
3 & M & 2 & 6 & 10 \\
4 & N & 2 & 6 & 10 & 14 \\
\end{array}
\end{array}$$


[[Ionization Energy]] - minimum energy to remove e- from atom
- nth ionization energy to remove nth e-
	- nth energy lower than n+1th energy
- metals low
- increases up and right
[[Electron Affinity]] ($\chi$) - change in energy when e- added to atom
- lower for metals
- increases up and right
[[Electronegativity]] - how much atom pulls binding pair towards it
- fluorine most electroneg
- metals lower
- increases up and right
