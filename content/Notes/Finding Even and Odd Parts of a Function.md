Every function can be written as the sum of even and odd functions, even if the function is neither even nor odd (see [[Even and Odd Functions]]). To separate a function into its even and odd parts:
$$
f_{e,o}(x)= \frac{f(x)+f(-x)}{2}+ \frac{f(x)-f(-x)}{2}
$$
where the first ratio is the even part and the second is the odd part
