Frequency is how quickly a repeating event occurs. A higher frequency means the event occurs more often per unit of [[Time]]. It is measured in Hertz (Hz) which measures events per second. [[Angular Velocity|Angular Frequency]] is frequency scaled by $2\pi$ to measure radians per second.

The reciprocal of frequency is the period, the time interval between events and the origin of the name periodic:
$$
f=\frac{1}{T}
$$
where
- $f$ = frequency
- $T$ = [[Period]]

>[!note]
>An octave above a certain frequency is double the frequency, while a decade above is ten times the frequency.


 Frequency can also be thought of as the rate of change of the phase of the signal:
 
 $$
f(t)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{d\theta(t)}{dt}
$$

 where
- $f$ = [[Frequency]]
- $\theta$ = [[Phase Angle|Phase]]
- $t$ = [[Time]]
