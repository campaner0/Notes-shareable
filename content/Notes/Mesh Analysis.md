  #Circuit_Analysis 

Mesh analysis is useful for circuits with many loops as it involves simultaneous [[Kirchhoff's Voltage Law|KVL]] equations to solve for unknown [[Current]]s. Each mesh is a closed loop with no loops within it. The process is:

1. Assign an analytic current to each loop with arbitrary direction
2. Write a KVL equation for each loop taking into account the current direction and overlaping currents
3. Solve the equations simultaneously


## Supermesh
Regular mesh analysis does not work with independent current sources. In this case, use a loop that bypasses the current source.
