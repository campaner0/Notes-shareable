Gauss's Law states that the [[Electric Flux]] out of an arbitrary closed surface is proportional to the charge inside the surface. 

## Integral form:
$$
\int_S\vec{D}\cdot d\vec{s}=Q
$$
where
- $\vec{s}$ = [[Surface Vector]]
- $Q$ = total [[Charge]] of object

## Differential form:
$$
\nabla\cdot\vec{D}=\rho_v
$$
where
- $\vec{D}$ = [[Electric Displacement Field]]
- $\rho_v$ = volume [[Charge Distribution]]


For any closed Gaussian surface, the electric flux is the ratio of total charge inside the surface to vacuum [[Permittivity]]:
$$
\Phi_E=\oiint_S\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{s}=\frac{Q}{\varepsilon_{0}}
$$
