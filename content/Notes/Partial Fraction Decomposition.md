Partial fraction decomposition is an algebraic process to separate a ratio of two polynomials into the sum of two or more ratios with simpler numerators ($P(x)$) and denominators ($Q(x)$) which are factors of the original denominator. There is a different process for the different combinations of order of numerator and denominator:


## P < Q
1. Factor denominator
2. Set new fraction equal to sum of $n$ fractions with unknown numerators, where $n$ is the number of factors in denominator, and whose denominators are one of each of the factors of the denominator
3. Set the unknown numerator of the first fraction in the sum to a fraction with the original numerator and every denominator fraction but the one that was in the sum fraction
4. Solve for the unknown numerator
5. Repeat for each fraction in the sum

>Another method is described in [[Partial Fraction Cases for Laplace Transforms]]. The process for repeated roots is also listed. $s$ may be treated as a variable
