Acceleration is a [[Vector]] quantity defined as the [[Derivative]] of [[Velocity]] and the second derivative of [[Position]]. Units: meters per second squared ($m/s^2$)
$$
\begin{aligned} 
\vec{a}&=\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} \\[2ex]
&={d^2\vec{r}\over dt^2}
\end{aligned}
$$
where
- $\vec{a}$ = acceleration
- $\vec{v}$ = velocity
- $t$ = [[Time]]

### Newton's Second Law
An object's acceleration is directly proportional to the [[Force]] on, and inversly proportional to the [[Mass]] of, an object (see [[Newton's Second Law]]).

---

### Acceleration Due to Gravity
The acceleration toward the earth due to the force of gravity depends on how close the object is to earth (see [[Gravity#Acceleration Due to Gravity]])

### Circular Motion
When an object rotates around an axis, it experiences tengential, centripital, and [[Angular Acceleration]] (see [[Circular Motion]]).
