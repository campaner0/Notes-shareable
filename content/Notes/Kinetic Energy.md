Kinetic energy is the [[Energy]] of motion, and is therefore related to [[Velocity]]. Formally, it is the [[Work]] done to accelerate an object to a certain velocity from rest. Units: Joule ($J$)

### Newtonian
In Newtonian mechanics, kinetic energy is calculated as:
$$
E_k=\frac 12mv^2
$$
where
- $E_k$ = kinetic energy
- $m$ = [[Mass]]
- $v$ = velocity

This is derived from the mathmatical defenition of work with constant acceleration. It is a good approximation for speeds much less than the speed of light

##### Rotating Objects
The total kinetic energy for a rotating object is the sum of its kinetic energy due to linear motion and that due to its rotation:
$$
E_k=\frac 12mv^2+\frac 12I\omega^2
$$
where
- $I$ = [[Moment of Inertia]]
- $\omega$ = [[Angular Velocity]]

### Relativistic
Taking into account [[Special Relativity]], 
$$
E_k=(\gamma-1)mc^2
$$
where
- $\gamma$ = [[Lorentz Factor]]
- $c$ = speed of light
