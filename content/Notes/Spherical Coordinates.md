The spherical coordinate system is a 3d coordinate system which determines the [[Position]] of a point $P$ in space using radial [[Distance]] from the origin and the polar (elevation) and azimuthal [[Angle|Angles]] of a line which intersects the origin and the point. 

$$
P = (r,\theta,\phi)
$$
where
- $r$ = distance from origin
- $\theta$ = elevation angle
- $\phi$ = azimuth angle

>[!warning]
>The meaning of the symbols described here follows the ISO convention often found in physics, but many math texts will use a different scheme where the meanings of $\theta$ and $\phi$ are switched[^1]:
>$$\begin{align*}
P&= (r,\theta,\phi)\\[5pt]
&= (\rho,\theta,\phi)
\end{align*}$$

>- $\rho$ = radial distance
>- $\theta$ = azimuth angle
