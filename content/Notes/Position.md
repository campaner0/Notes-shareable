The position [[Vector]] (denoted as $\vec r$ or $\vec x$) represents the location of a point in space relative to the origin. Also known as displacement. [[Velocity]] is the derivative of position, and [[Acceleration]] is its second derivative. 

For a moving object, $dx = v\,dt$. Therefore:
$$
x_f=x_i+v\Delta t
$$
where
- $x_i$ = initial position
- $x_f$ = final position
- $v$ = velocity
- $\Delta t$ = change in [[Time]]

Substituting the equation relating velocity to acceleration and integrating with respect to $t$:
$$
x_f=x_i+v_i\Delta{t}+\frac12a\Delta{t^2}
$$
where
- $a$ = acceleration
