Electric charge is a property of matter that causes it to experience repulsion or attraction in the presence of other charged matter due to the [[Electromagnetic Force]]. 
- opposites attract, same charge repels
- can be positive, negative, neutral (no charge)
- charge is conserved, like [[Energy]]

Charge can be quantized. That is, the value of charge on any object is an integer multiple of the elementary charge $e$:
$$
q=\pm{Ne}
$$
where
- $q$ = charge of object (Coulombs)
- $N\in{\Bbb{Z}}$
- $e=1.6022\times10^{-19}\,\text C$ = elementary charge
