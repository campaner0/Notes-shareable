Utilitarianism is a moral theory that places the benefit of society over the benefit of an individual or smaller group. In Star Trek, there is a Vulcan saying that summarizes this view: "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few." According to this theory, if an action harms an individual or minority group of society, it is acceptable if the larger society benefits to an extent that outweighs the detriment to the minority. 

At times, this theory may conflict with [[Rights Ethics]], which argue for the rights of individuals.

### Possible Abuse
A government or institution of power may justify frivolous or malicious actions by wielding this moral theory, falsely stating their actions benefit society when, in reality, they benefit those in power at the detriment of society.
