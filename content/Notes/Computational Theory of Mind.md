The computational theory of mind, or CTM, (not to be confused with the [[Computational Theory of Cognition]]) describes the human mind as an information processing system and posits that cognition and consciousness are a form of computation. Not just that the mind is analogous to a computer program, but that it *is* a computational system. 

This system is implemented in neurons and neural activity in the brain. If computation is understood as the operation of [[Turing Machine|Turing Machines]], then the computation of the mind could conceivably be replicated on non-biological hardware, such as a silicon chip. Thus, simulation of a mind would be synonymous with the presence of a mind.

## Searle's Criticism
Philosopher John Searle criticized the CTM based on its Turing machine definition of the mind through the [[Chinese Room]] thought experiment. The man inside the room has no understanding of the symbols he writes or the larger context of the conversation. He simply returns some symbols according to a [[Lookup Table]]. This is in contrast to a human mind that responds in conversation while understanding what it is saying. Therefore, a Turing machine that simply acts on symbols according to a set of rules does not entail understanding of the symbols or intentionality in process, two known aspects of human minds.
