### Waves in a Lossy Medium
In a lossy medium, a linear wave is described by:
$$
y(x,t)=Ae^{-\alpha x}\cos\left(\omega t-\beta x+\phi_0\right)
$$
where
- $A$ = peak amplitude
- $\alpha$ = [[Attenuation|Neper Frequency]]
- $\omega$ = [[Angular Velocity]]
- $\beta$ = [[Wave Number]]
- $t$ = [[Time]]
- $x$ = [[Position]] in space
- $\phi_0$ = reference [[Phase Angle]]

>[!note]
>The exponential term describes the attenuation of the wave as it travels. In a lossless medium, $\alpha=0$ and the wave is not damped
