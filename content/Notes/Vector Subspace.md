In linear algebra, a [[Subset]] of a [[Vector Space]] $V$ is a vector subspace $H$ of $V$ if:

1. $\vec{0}\in V$ is also in $H$
2. $H$ is closed under addition
	- That is, $\forall\,\vec{u},\vec{v}\in H,\;\vec{u}+\vec{v}\in H$
3. $H$ is closed under scalar multiplication
	- That is, $\forall\,\vec{u}\in H,\;c\vec{u}\in H$ where $c\in\mathbb{R}$
