If the inductor or capcitor is charged, the energy will oscillate between each component. Since energy is conserved, and the [[Voltage]] across the two are the same, the following emerges:
$$
\frac{d^2q}{dt^2}=-\frac q{LC}
$$
The equations that describe the oscillation of energy in this circuit are the same as those that describe all oscillations. (see [[Waves]]) This oscillation will continue forever if there is no resistance. If there is, it will be damped ([[RLC Circuits]])

This circuit oscillates at:
$$
\omega=\frac 1{\sqrt{LC}}
$$
where
- $\omega$ = [[Angular Velocity|Angular Frequency]]
- $L$ = [[Inductance]]
- $C$ = [[Capacitance]]
