Displacement current is the product of [[Permittivity]] and the derivative of [[Electric Flux]]:
$$
I_d=\varepsilon_0\frac {d\Phi_E}{dt}
$$
The displacement current term is necessary to explain the presence of a magnetic field where there is no current flow, such as between the plates of a capacitor. In this case, the mag field is created by a faux current that flows in the region, which is the displacement current.
