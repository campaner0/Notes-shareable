Definition in terms of the exponential function using [[Euler's Formula]]:
$$
\cos\theta=\mathfrak{Re}(e^{i\theta})=\frac{e^{i\theta}+e^{-i\theta}}{2}
$$

When visualized in a two sided [[Spectral Plot]], the cosine wave will have two peaks at $\pm\omega$ with height of $A/2$. These two peaks represent two phasors which rotate in opposite directions (the exponentials above). In a one-sided plot, there will be one peak at $\omega$.
