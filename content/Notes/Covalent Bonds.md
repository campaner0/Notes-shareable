  #Chemistry 

A covalent bond is a type of [[Chemical Bonds|Chemical Bond]] that involves the sharing of valence [[Electron|Electrons]] between [[Atomic Theory|Atoms]]. 

## (Non)Polar Bonds
In a nonpolar covalent bond, two atoms share pairs of valence electrons roughly equally between them. Polar covalent bonds have a greater ionic character, so the shared electrons are closer to one atom than the other which results in an imbalance of charge, and a polar bond.

The presence of polar bonds in a molecule does not necessarily mean the molecule is polar. A symmetrical molecule with all polar bonds will not be polar. For example, methane:

Asymmetrical molecules with polar bonds are generally permanently polar molecules, or [[Electric Dipole Moment]]s.  Polar bonds will have a difference in electronegativity of the atoms of between 0.3 and 1.7.
