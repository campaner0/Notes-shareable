  #Circuit_Analysis 

It is useful to define [[Frequency]] as a complex number in order to make calculations around transient and steady-state analysis easier using the [[Laplace Transform]] and to describe how a signal attenuates. Complex frequency is defined as:

$$
s=\sigma+j\omega
$$
where
- $\sigma$ = [[Attenuation|Neper Frequency]]
- $\omega$ = [[Angular Velocity|Angular Frequency]]
