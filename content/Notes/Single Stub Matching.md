1. convert load impedance to admittance and normalize
2. plot load admittance on smith chart
3. draw SWR circle with center at 1, radius of admittance
4. draw line through point at intersection with 1.0 circle
distance between load and this is distance of stub from load
5. plot point on edge at negative of impedance of second point
distance from here to 0.25 is length of stub
