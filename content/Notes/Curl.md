The curl of a vector field is the circulation per unit area of the region whose contour has the maximum [[Circulation]]:
$$
\nabla\times\vec{V}=\hat{n}\left(\lim_{A\to0} \frac{1}{|A|}\oint_C\vec{V}\cdot d\vec{l}\right)
$$
where
- $\vec V$ = [[Vector Field]]
- $\nabla\times\vec{V}$ = curl of V
- $\hat n$ = [[Normal Vector]] to surface
- $A$ = [[Area]] of surface

### Stokes' Theorem

Stokes' Theorem states that the line integral around the boundary of a surface in a vector field is equal to the integral of the curl of the field over the surface. The surface integral can also be said to be the [[Flux]] of the curl of the vector field through the surface. 
$$
\oint_C\vec{F}\cdot d\vec{l}=\int_S(\nabla\times\vec{F})\cdot d\vec{s}
$$
where
- $\vec{F}$ = vector field
