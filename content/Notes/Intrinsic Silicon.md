- 4 valence e-
- Bonds covalently
- Thermal generation of ehp (e- hole pair)
	- When thermal energy applied, e- become free in random locations
		- This is where waves meet like ripples in water
		- Leaves hole behind, which another free e- fills
		- Thermal energy expressed in lattice vibrations
		- As temp goes up, resistance goes down - opposite of metals
	- Free e- concentration
		- Bandgap energy Eg (eV, electron volt) - energy to produce a free e-
			- 1 eV = 1.6 x 10-19J
			- Si = 1.1 eV
			- Ge = 0.7 eV
			- GeTe = 1.5 eV
			- Metals =Â  0 eV
			- Most semicons = 1 to 3 eV
		- Probability to create free e- very low, increases with temp

$$
n_{0}=N_{c}\exp\left(-\frac{E_{g}}{2kT}\right)
$$
where
- $N_c=2.8\times 10^{19}\left(\frac{T}{300}\right)^{3/2}$ = effective density of states in conduction band
- $E_g$ = bandgap energy
- $k$ = [[Boltzmann Constant]]
- $T$ = absolute [[Temperature]]

$n_i=1.5\times 10^{10}\text{cm}^{-3}$ (constant)
