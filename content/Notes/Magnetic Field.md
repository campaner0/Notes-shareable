The magnetic field is a [[Vector Field]] which describes the magnetic influence on moving charges, [[Current]]s, and magnetic materials. Two distinct but closely related fields may be described by the term "magnetic field". These are the $\vec{B}$ and $\vec{H}$ fields. In mediums where the two are directly proportional, they are related through the permeability of the medium:
$$
\vec{B}=\mu \vec{H}
$$
where
- $\mu$ = [[Permeability]]

### B Field
unit Tesla $T=10^4$ Gauss. 


---

### H Field
unit A/m

#### Sources of the Magnetic Field
[[Biot-Savart Law]]

##### Ampere's Law
(see [[Ampere's Law]])

#### Magnetic Flux
[[Magnetic Flux]] is the mag field that passes through a a certain surface.

#### Applications of Magnetic Field
[[Velocity Selector]], [[Mass Spectrometer]], [[Cyclotron]], [[Transformer]]
