  #Physics 

The electron volt (eV) is a unit of [[Energy]] defined by the amount of [[Kinetic Energy]] gained by an [[Electron]] accelerating from rest through an [[Voltage|Electric Potential]] difference of 1 volt in a vacuum: $E=qV$. Therefore, the value of 1 eV in Joules is the same as the numerical value of 1 elementary [[Charge]]:
$$
1\,\text{eV}=1.6022\times10^{-19}\,\text{J}
$$
