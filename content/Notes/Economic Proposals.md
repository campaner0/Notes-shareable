When selecting between two or more proposals based on their possible ROI, they must be sorted into mutually exclusive and independent projects. Each project is converted into [[Current Value|Present Worth]] using the [[MARR]]. 

### Mutually Exclusive
For mutually exclusive projects, only one may be selected as the name implies. They compete against each other, so the one with the highest return or lowest cost is selected.

### Independent
Independent projects compete only against doing nothing, and any which have a PW above 0 are justified.
