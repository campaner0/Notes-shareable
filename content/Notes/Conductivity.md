Conductivity is an intrinsic property of materials which refers to the the ease with which a [[Current]] flows through it. It is defined as:
$$
\sigma = qn\mu
$$
where
- $q$ = [[Charge]] of an electron
- $n$ = number of free [[Electron|Electrons]] per cubic centimeter
- $\mu$ = charge carrier mobility
