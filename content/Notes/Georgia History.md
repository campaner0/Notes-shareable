## Pre-Colonial
The geographical area now known as Georgia has been inhabited since the end of the [[Ice Age]] around 13,000 years ago by hunter-gatherers. These peoples became more sedentary and founded permanent settlements marked by the numerous mounds and structures left behind. Chiefdoms began to coalesce into larger societies such as the [[Cherokee]] and [[Creek]], due to their decline as a result of European arrival. Before the arrival of the English, the area was explored by the Spanish, most notably by [[Hernando de Soto]], in the mid 1500s to mid 1600s. These included some short-lived Catholic missions.

## Establishment of the Colony
English settlers first arrived from across the Savannah River from South Carolina to trade in deer skins and Indian slaves, but a formal colony was not established until 1732, the last of [[The Original 13 Colonies]]. James Oglethorpe envisioned a new colony as a haven for former imprisoned debtors. King George II granted a charter to the board of trustees, but, ultimately, there were no debtors among the first colonists to set foot in what would be [[Savannah]].

Georgia was founded and governed by the board of trustees based in London for its first 20 years. There was no governor based in the colony itself. Slavery was outlawed along with rum and Catholics as a remnant of the initial motivation, but all these were legalized as the board weakened, until a governor was royally appointed in 1752. The crown wanted Georgia as a buffer to protect South Carolina from Spanish incursions.

## Revolutionary Period
Because of its relatively low population, Georgia did not play a large role in the revolutionary war, though many Georgians were aligned with British interests as they welcomed the presence of British troops to defend against Indian attacks. During the siege of Savannah, French and American troops attempted unsuccessfully to capture the city from the British. 

At the [[Second Continental Congress]], three representatives from the colony signed the [[Declaration of Independence]]: [[Button Gwinnett]], [[Lyman Hall]], and [[George Walton]]. Later, [[Abraham Baldwin]] and [[William Few Jr.]] signed the new U.S. Constitution. Georgia became the fourth state when it ratified the Constitution in 1788. The University of Georgia was established around this time (three years earlier then the ratification of the Constitution), notably being the first university to be established by a state government in the U.S. 

Since slavery was now legal, the rice and cotton industries were quickly established, and the Black Belt region formed after the invention of the cotton gin by [[Eli Whitney]] during a visit to a Georgia plantation in 1793. 

Also notable in this period is the [[Trail of Tears]], in which the Cherokees were forcibly removed from Georgia. This was far from the only instance of Indian removal, but it became a symbol of the suffering that occurred in all such removals. Georgia was also the only state to be challenged in court (*[[Worchester vs. Georgia]]*) over Indian sovereignty. 

The construction of railroads connecting Augusta, Savannah, Athens, Macon, and Terminus (later Atlanta) occurred during this time, leading to Georgia being an important front in the Civil War.

## Civil War and Reconstruction
Having the largest population of enslaved people and white slave owners, Georgia played a crucial role in the [[The Secession Crisis in Georgia|Secession Crisis]]. Though there was controversy among the convention delegates (the northern mountains and southeastern regions having few slave owners), most delegates voted to secede from the Union on January 19, 1861. 

Several Georgians played significant roles in the new Confederate government: [[Howell Cobb]] led the organizing convention for the Confederate government, and his brother [[Thomas R. R. Cobb]] wrote most of the Confederate Constitution. [[Alexander Stephens]] was [[Jefferson Davis]]' vice president, and [[Robert Toombs]] served as secretary of state. Georgia governor [[Joseph E. Brown]] ironically heavily opposed the centralizing efforts of Davis' administration. 

Perhaps the most famous Civil War campaign in Georgia was [[William T. Sherman]]'s incursion into the state from Chattanooga and the fall of Atlanta, followed by [[Sherman's March to the Sea]]. This led to the occupation of Savannah in December of 1864, only a few months after the capture of Atlanta. 

The [[Andersonville Prison Camp]] was a Confederate prison camp that held Union prisoners of war. It was the largest in the south became notorious for its high casualty rate. Henry Wirz was commander of the camp and was notably the only Confederate executed for war crimes. 

Ultimately, over 460,000 people were freed from slavery during and after the war, but racial violence continued along with political tensions. Federal troops occupied much of the south after the war's end, adding to the tension. The [[Ku Klux Klan]] and [[Freedman's Bureau]] played prominent roles in this period. In 1868, the [[General Assembly]] expelled 27 black republican legislators despite the fact that the governor and a majority of the state senate were republicans. This, along with the [[Camilla Massacre]], led to Congress reimposing military rule in Georgia and to deny the Georgia congressmen entry into the House of Representatives. They were not allowed entry until 1870, five years after the end of the war, making Georgia the last state to be readmitted into the Union. 

Reconstruction ended relatively early in Georgia, by 1871 the state government was under the control of white conservative Democrats known as "Redeemers".

## The "New South" and Populism
Spearheaded by [[Henry W. Grady]] and the Bourbon Triumvirate (Confederate governor Joseph E. Brown and Confederate generals John B. Gordon and Alfred H. Colquitt), the so called New South initiative was an effort to industrialize the state and build a prosperous future. Grady fashioned the picture of Atlanta rising like a phoenix from the ashes of the war, but this idea often was at odds with reality. The Bourbon Triumvirate worked to industrialize the state, but often for their own profit, and Georgia remained mostly rural. 

While the government focused on business and industry, the majority of residents were farmers and struggled to subsist in a market damaged by the loss of slave labor and low global demand for cotton. This pressured farmers into tenant farming and the crop lien system, which had an exploitative credit system. By 1920, 2/3 of farmers were sharecroppers and did not own land. 

[[Thomas E. Watson]] organized the Populist Party in 1892, supporting banking and railroad reform and cooperative farm exchange. Most notably, white and black farmers were both encouraged to participate. Watson was nominated as the Party's candidate for vice president, but the Republicans ultimately won the election.

## Jim Crow
In reaction to the Populist effort to bring together blacks and whites, the Bourbon Triumvirate moved to limit the voting power of black citizens and formalize segregation. In addition to the poll tax, literacy and property ownership requirements were added in an amendment to the state constitution. Laws requiring segregation in public facilities were also passed. At the same time, lynchings spiked in frequency such that more lynchings took place between 1889 and 1918 in Georgia than anywhere else in the country. 

Most infamous was the 1915 lynching of [[Leo Frank]], a Jew accused of the murder of Mary Phagan and the race massacre in Atlanta that lasted three days in 1906. A few months after the Leo Frank lynching, the KKK was resurrected with a ceremony on [[Stone Mountain]].

## The Great Depression and WWII
In 1915, the arrival of the [[Boll Weevil]] added to the already bad conditions for farmers. Cotton production dropped to a fourth of its already reduced yield, and half of all farmers in Georgia abandoned the profession, with more than 400,000 (mostly black) residents moving to other regions. 

When [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|FDR]] was inaugurated in 1933, he was aware of the situation among farmers in Georgia due to the time he spent in Warm Springs for polio treatments. He created the Agricultural Adjustment Administration to address the low price of crops by lowering production. However, this put more farmers out of work and rural populations continued to dwindle. Some towns attracted employers such as textile mills using inducements financed by public subscription and the promise of cheap labor. 

The depression ended with the United States' entry into World War II as the war effort created thousands of jobs in military industry. Georgia was not excluded from these effects. [[Fort Moore|Fort Benning]] was the largest infantry training post in the world at the time, and the ports of Savannah and Brunswick built cargo ships under the Emergency Shipbuilding Program. Bell Bomber also produced B-29 planes from 1943-45. In the ten years between 1940 and 1950, personal income in Georgia had risen from >$350 to <$1000. 

The birth of Georgia's aviation industry also occurred around this time. Ben Epps was the first to fly in the state, building his own airplane and flying in Athens. [[Charles Lindbergh]] also flew his first solo flight in Georgia at Souther Field. William B. Hartsfield established Hartsfield Airport two years later, which is now Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.

## Civil Rights 
With the landmark Supreme Court ruling in *[[Brown v. Board of Education]]*, school segregation across the country was ruled unconstitutional. In Georgia, some advocated for the closure of public schools instead of integration, and, as a result of the court's decision, the confederate battle flag was added to the state flag in its redesign in 1956. Nevertheless, a commission formed by segregationist governor Ernest Vandiver Jr. and headed by John A. Sibley recommended individual communities to have the option to close schools rather than a statewide mandate. The commission was also key in dissuading the governor from closing UGA when two black students, Hamilton Holmes and Charlayne Hunter, were admitted by court order.

Despite Atlanta being a large population center in the state, the voting power of its residents was significantly stifled by the county unit system, in which votes in the primaries were allotted by county, giving counties with much lower population the same power as those with higher populations. This resulted in the "rustics," gaining an edge over the more racially moderate and economically progressive Atlantans. [[Eugene Talmadge]] was a prime example, as he won the gubernatorial race without ever campaigning in a city. The county unit system was overturned by a federal district court in 1962, which was an important step toward shifting power away from the rustics.

Atlanta was the base of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s operations in the south (as well as his birth city) and the headquarters of his Southern Christian Leadership Conference. The [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] also had a strong presence in Georgia, where it worked to challenge segregation in all areas.

Following the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the number of black voters quickly doubled, and the number of black elected officials rose 10x between 1962 and 1970. Carl Sanders was also elected governor and worked to bring the state in line with federal civil rights laws. Civil rights legislation was largely implemented by the Democratic party, causing the white electorate to break with the national party for the first time in Georgia. Across the south, white voters began to align with the Republican Party instead. [[Lester Maddox]], a segregationist, won the governorship after Sanders (though he was not a republican), and Georgia voted Republican in subsequent presidential elections, with the exception of [[Jimmy Carter]] (though he won the black but not the white vote).

## The Sunbelt
From the seventies onward, the southern part of the country began to be known as the sunbelt due to its economic and demographic resurgence, with its heart in Atlanta. The city expanded in size and population and became the home of UPS which joined native Coca-Cola, The Home Depot, and Tuner Broadcasting. In 1996, Atlanta hosted the Centennial Summer Olympic Games, which raised the city's international profile. 

Georgia's carpet industry achieved national prominence along with poultry, peaches, peanuts, and Vidalia onions, though farms followed the national trend of consolidation from many smaller farms to fewer large ones. Overall, the farm population shrank considerably.

## The 21st Century
[[Sonny Perdue]], elected in 2003, was the first Republican governor to be elected since reconstruction. This marked Georgia's transition to mostly Republican allegiance, along with many state and federal legislators. 

Many manufacturing jobs moved oversees during the 21st century, and Georgia was no exception to this. Almost 100,000 jobs were lost in manufacturing, mostly textiles and apparel. Agriculture, on the other hand, attracted many Latino immigrants, though many left during the 2008 recession. 

A drought in the middle of the decade created a conflict between Georgia, Alabama, and Florida over water, as much was being diverted to supply the growing population of the Atlanta metro area, which had surpassed Boston and Detroit. The city is still the major economic hub of Georgia despite facing issues of poverty which span rural and urban areas.
