Mass is a physical property of matter that describes the quantity of matter and its resistance to [[Acceleration]]. An object with a large mass will resist movement more than a less massive object (see [[Inertia]]). Units: $kg$ (kilogram)

Mass is perhaps most famously present in [[Newton's Second Law]], which describes the relationship of mass, acceleration, and [[Force]].


### Rotational Equivalent
[[Moment of Inertia]] is used instead of mass to describe an object's rotational inertia as opposed to linear inertia.
