Diffraction is the interference of waves resulting from the waves' bending around a corner or reflecting off of different planes of a material's surface. 

When diffraction is caused by reflection off of planes of different depths, constructive interference will occur only when the difference in length of the beam's path is an integer multiple of the wavelength:
$$
n \lambda=2d\sin \theta
$$
where
- $n\in \mathbb{Z}$
- $\lambda$ = [[Wavelength]]
- $d$ = interplanar spacing
- $\theta$ = [[Angle]] between beam and plane of reflection

$$
d_{hkl}=\frac{a}{\sqrt{h^{2}+k^{2}+\ell^{2}}}
$$
where
- $a$ = lattice parameter
- $(hk\ell)$ = [[Crystal Structures#Miller Indices|Miller Indices]]

>[!note]
>The Bragg (or diffraction) angle is double the angle between beam and reflection plane: $2\theta$


### X-Ray Diffraction Pattern
The pattern of interference obtained by scanning a material with [[X-rays]] is that material's X-ray diffraction pattern. Peaks indicate constructive interference at that diffraction angle. Each crystal structure will have its own sequence of peaks, so the diffraction pattern can be used as a sort of fingerprint to identify materials.

Sharper peaks indicate higher crystallinity, and secondary phases (extraneous compounds) will show up with their own peaks. These indicators help to ascertain the quality of the grown crystal. A wider peak can indicate crystal defects and disorders. These include grains on the nano scale (nano crystals) as opposed to the micro scale.
