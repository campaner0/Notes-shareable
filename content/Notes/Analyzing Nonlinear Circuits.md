To analyze a circuit with nonlinear elements such as a [[P-N Junction Diode|Diode]], follow these steps:

1. Make an assumption about the state of the nonlinear elements
2. Create equivalent circuit using models, assumptions
3. Analyze circuit
4. Verify that results support assumptions. If not, analyze again with results in mind
