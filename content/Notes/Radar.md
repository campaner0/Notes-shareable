unambiguous range - maximum range a target can have s.t. echo is received before next pulse sent
$$
R_u=\frac{cT_{p}}{2}
$$
where
- $c$  = [[Speed of Light]]
- $T_p$ = [[Period]] of pulses

range resolution - max spacing between targets to differentiate between them
$$
\Delta R=R_{1}-R_{2}=\frac{c\tau}{2}
$$
where
- $\tau$ = 

azimuth resolution
$$
\Delta x=\beta R
$$
where
- $\beta$ = beamwidth

maximum detectable range
$$
R_{max}=\left[\frac{P_{\mathrm{t}}\tau G^{2}\lambda^{2}\sigma_{\mathrm{t}}}{(4\pi)^{3}K\,T_{\mathrm{sys}}S_{\mathrm{min}}}\right]^{1/4}
$$
where
- $P_t$ = transmitted power
- $G$ = gain
- $\sigma_t$ = radar cross section of target
- $k$ = [[Boltzmann Constant]]
- $T_{sys}$ = system noise [[Temperature]] of receiver
- $S_{min}$ = minimum signal to noise ratio
