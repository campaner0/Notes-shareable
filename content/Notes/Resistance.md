$$
R=\rho\,\frac{L}{A}
$$
where
- $\rho$ = [[Resistivity]] of material
- $L$ = length 
- $A$ = cross sectional [[Area]]


sheet resistance
Resistance of very thin films is determined by measuring the resistance across two metal pads on top of the film. 

$$
\begin{align*}
R_{s} &= \rho\left(\frac{L}{tW}\right)\\
&= \frac{\rho}{t}
\end{align*}
$$
where 
- $L$ = distance between metal contacts
- $W$ = width of contacts
- $t$ = thickness of the film
