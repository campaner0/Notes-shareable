The wave number is the spatial frequency of a wave, or its cycles per unit distance. This is analogous to temporal [[Frequency]], or cycles per unit time. It is defined as:
$$
\tilde{v}=\frac{1}{\lambda}
$$
where
- $\lambda$ = [[Wavelength]]

The angular wave number, in radians, is defined as:
$$\begin{align*}
k&= \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\\[5pt]
&= \frac{\omega}{v_{p}}
\end{align*}$$
where
- $\omega$ = [[Angular Velocity|Angular Frequency]]
- $v_p$ = phase velocity (see [[Electromagnetic Wave]])

>[!note]
>In a vacuum, $v_{p}=c$, where $c$ is the [[Speed of Light]]
