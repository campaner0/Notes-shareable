Voltage, or electric potential/electromotive force, is defined as the amount of [[Work]] required to move a charge between two points in an electric field. This is the difference in electric potential between two points, which can be found by integrating over the electric field between the points:
$$
V_{21}=V_2-V_1=-\int_{P_1}^{P_2}\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{l}
$$
where
- $\vec{E}$ = [[Electric Field]]
