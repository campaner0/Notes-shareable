Similarly to [[Electric Flux]], magnetic flux is the magnetic field through a certain area. For an enclosed area this is described by the product of the magnetic field and area. Units: Weber ($Wb$)
$$
\Phi_B=\int\vec{B}\cdot d\vec{A}
$$
where
- $\vec B$ = [[Magnetic Field|Magnetic Flux Density]]
- $\vec A$ = Area

If the flux is constant and perpendicular to the area:
$$
\Phi_B=BA
$$

#### Gauss's Law in Magnetism
Gauss's Law in magnitism states that the net magnetic flux through any closed surface is zero. This is given by:
$$
\int\vec{B}\cdot d\vec{s}=0
$$
where
- $\vec{s}$ = vector area of surface

In most cases, $\vec{B}$ and $\vec{s}$ are colinear, so their dot product is zero

#### Faraday's Law of Induction
[[Faraday's Law of Induction]] describes the relationship of mag flux and [[Voltage]]. Changing mag field can induce a [[Current]] in a a conductor.

##### Lenz's Law
Lenz's Law states that the induced current in a loop is in the direction that creates an opposing mag field to the **change** in mag flux through the loop. It opposes increase or decrease in flux.
