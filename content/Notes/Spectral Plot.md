A spectral plot is displayed by a frequency analyzer. It has the [[Frequency]] on the horizontal axis and amplitude (and sometimes [[Phase Angle|Phase]]) on the vertical axis. Peaks on the plot display which frequencies are present in a signal and at what amplitude. This information is found using a [[Fourier Transform]].
