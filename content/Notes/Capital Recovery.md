Capital Recovery is the equivalent annual amount that an investment must earn each year to recover the initial cost and a stated [[Rate of Return|ROR]] over its expected life. 
$$
CR = -P(A/P,i\%,n)+S(A/F,i\%,n)
$$
where
- $P$ = [[Current Value|Present Worth]]
- $A$ = [[Annual Payments]]
- $i$ = [[Interest and Interest Rate|Interest Rate]]
- $S$ = [[Salvage Value]]
- $n$ = life expectancy in number of [[Time]] periods

>[!note]
>CR is [[Annual Worth Analysis|Annual Worth]] minus A
>$$
\text{CR}=\text{AW}-\text{A}
