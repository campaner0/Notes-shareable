Selecting an investment with the highest [[Rate of Return|ROR]] may not yield the highest return if the investment amount is not the same as the available capital. The [[Weighted Average]] of total availible capital must be considered. Uninvested capital is assumed to earn interest at [[Minimum Attractive Rate of Return|MARR]].

Investing less money at a higher [[Interest and Interest Rate|Interest Rate]] may give a higher ROR then more money invested at a lower interest rate, but, considering the uninvested amount, the overall ROR may be lower. This is called the ranking inconsistency problem, and IRR analysis must be used.
