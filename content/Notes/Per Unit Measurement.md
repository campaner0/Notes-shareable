In a per unit measurement system, values are measured as a decimal fraction of a base level instead of the SI units:
$$
\text{Quantity per Unit}=\frac{\text{Actual Value}}{\text{Base Value}}
$$
Using the per unit measurement system speeds up calculations in circuits with [[Transformer|Transformers]] as no impedance transformations need to be done. To use this system, a base apparant [[Electrical Power]] and [[Voltage]] are chosen at an arbitrary location in the circuit. Transformers do not affect the apparant power as it flows through them, therefore the base power does not change because of a transformer. However, base voltage will change according to turns ratio, which negates the need to reference all voltages to a common level.

## Application
For transformers,
