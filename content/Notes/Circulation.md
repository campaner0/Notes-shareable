The circulation of a vector field is the rotational property of the field along a given contour. The circulation of a region of a vector field is found by integrating the vector field along the contour of the region:
$$
\text{Circulation}=\oint_C\vec{V}\cdot d\vec{l}
$$
where
- $\vec{V}$ = [[Vector Field]]
- $C$ = contour

>[!note]
>The [[Curl]] of a vector field is the circulation per unit area of the region whose contour has the maximum circulation
