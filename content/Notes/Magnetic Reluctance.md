Magnetic reluctance is the magnetic analog of electrical [[Resistance]]. It follows the same rules for series/parallel reluctances as resistors. Units: $H^{-1}$ (H = Henries). In [[Magnetically Coupled Circuits|Magnetic Circuits]]:
$$\begin{align*}
\mathcal{R}&= \frac{\mathcal{F}}{\Phi}\\[5pt]
&= \frac{\ell}{\mu A}
\end{align*}$$
where
- $\mathcal{F}$ = [[Magnetomotive Force]]
- $\Phi$ = [[Magnetic Flux]]
- $\ell$ = length of path through [[Transformer]] core
- $\mu$ = [[Permeability]] of core
- $A$ = cross-sectional [[Area]] of core

>The inverse of resistance, [[Conductance]], also has a magnetic equivalent in [[Permeance]].
