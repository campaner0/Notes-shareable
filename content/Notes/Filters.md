In circuit analysis, filters are used to limit the frequencies of an [[Alternating Current|AC]] signal that pass through the filter. [[High-Pass Filter|High-Pass]] and [[Low-Pass Filter]]s allow high and low frequencies through, respectively (the passband). All others are [[Attenuation|Attenuated]] (the stopband). The corner (or cutoff) [[Frequency]] is the frequency at which the the signal begins to be attenuated. From this point down, the frequencies will be more and more attenuated.

Filter circuits can be either [[Passive Filters|Passive]] or [[Active Filters|Active]] depending on whether they include an [[Operational Amplifier|Op-Amp]].
