[[Current]] through or [[Voltage]] across component can be found by summing current/voltage at component due to each source
$$
i_x=i_x'+i_x''+\cdots+i_x^n
$$
$$
v_x=v_x'+v_x''+\cdots+v_x^n
$$
where
- $i^n$ or $v^n$ = current/voltage due to nth source

Process:
1. Deactivate all but one source
2. Calculate current/voltage at desired point
3. Move to next source and repeat
4. Add up results (remember to acount for direction)
