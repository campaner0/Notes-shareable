Moment of Inertia is the angular equivalent of [[Mass]]. The higher the moment of inertia, the greater [[Torque]] is required to achieve a certain [[Angular Acceleration]]. Also known as angular mass or rotational inertia. Units: $kg\cdot m^2$


### Motion in a Fixed Plane
Moment of inertia can be found through the ratio of [[Angular Momentum]] and [[Angular Velocity]]:
$$
I=\frac L\omega
$$
where
- $I$ = moment of inertia
- $L$ = angular momentum
- $\omega$ = angular velocity

If the dimensions of an object are known, its moment of inertia can be calcuated using these (assuming the axis of rotation is in the center of the object):
| Shape | Equation |
|----|----|
| Thin Hoop | $I=mr^2$ |
| Disc | $\frac 12 mr^2$ |
| Hollow disc | $\frac 12 m(r^2_{in}-r^2_{out})$ |
| Rod | $\frac 1{12}m\ell^2$ |
| Sphere | $\frac {2}{5}mR^2$ |
| Shell | $\frac 13mR^2$ |


### Kinetic Energy
The [[Kinetic Energy]] of a rotating body is dependedent on its rotational inertia.


### Parallel Axis Theorem
If the axis of rotation is not at the center of mass, or centroid, of the object, the [[Parallel Axis Theorem]] can be used to calculate its moment of inertia about the axis of rotation.
