A replacement study is done whenever an investment is considered for replacement due to deterioration, changing requirements/technology, under performance, etc. The defender is the currently installed asset, and the challenger is the potential replacement. These are mutually exclusive alternatives. A nonowner's (3rd party) viewpoint may be considered for objectivity.


## Economic Service Life
Economic service life, or minimum cost life of the asset, is the year where [[Annual Worth Analysis|AW]] of costs is the lowest. This is determined by the smallest total AW of costs, which identifies $n$, the ESL. Initial cost ([[Current Value|P]]), [[Salvage Value]], Annual Operation Cost (AOC), and estimated [[Interest and Interest Rate|Interest]] are considered.
$$
\text{Total AW}=-CR -\text{AW of AOC}
$$
where
- $CR$ = [[Capital Recovery]]

>[!note]
>If the estimated AOC series is not uniform:
>$$
\text{AW of AOC}=[\text{AOC}_1(P/F,i,1)+\text{AOC}_2(P/F,i,2)+\cdots+\text{AOC}_k(P/F,i,k)](A/P,i,k)
$$ 
>- where $k$ = number of years for evaluation

## Replacement Study
A replacement study determines when to replace the asset in question. If no study period is specified, find the ESL and compare AW of challenger and defender at that year, and select the option with lower AW. If a study period is specified, calculate AW for each over study period and select greater AW.
