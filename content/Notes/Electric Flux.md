  #Physics 

Electric flux is the measure of [[Electric Field]] strength through a given surface. Though the electric field does not flow, it is still useful to define the magnitude of the field as [[Flux]]. 

For a uniform electric field $\Phi_E$, the electric flux through a surface is:
$$
\Phi_E=\vec{E}\cdot\vec{S}=ES\cos\theta
$$
where
- $\vec E$ = electric field
- $\vec{S}$ = [[Surface Vector]]
- $\theta$ = angle between field lines and surface

For a non-uniform field, use [[Gauss's Law]]
