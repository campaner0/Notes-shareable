De Broglie wavelength
- particles exhibit wavelike behavior at high enough velocity

scanning e- microscope (SEM)
- sample chamber under vacuum
1. e- gun emits e- 
2. beam channeled through electromagnetic lenses
3. e- accelerated w/ high voltage to sample
4. beam scanned across sample
	- e- in beam penetrate sample and knock off orbiting e- on surface (secondary e-)
	- secondary e- emit from sample, are detected to form image

Transmission e- microscope (TEM)
- e- pass through very thin sample, detected below
	- sample placed on micron level mesh: allows e- to pass through
- silicon devices thinned down with focused ion beam milling so that it is viewable

Scanning Probe Microscope (SPM)
- basic mode: surface morphology (AFM)
	- contact
	- non-contact
	- tapping
- secondary
- function
	- cantilever probe tip oscillates at high frequency
		- high frequency signal to piezoelectric element
	- using laser reflected off probe, changes in vibration are detected
	- forces on probe due to proximity to surface atoms cause change in vibration


e- wavelength:
$$
\lambda=\frac{h}{\sqrt{2mqV}}
$$
where
- $h$ = [[Planck Length]]
- $m$ = [[Mass]] of particle
- $q$ = [[Charge]] 
- $V$ = [[Voltage]]
