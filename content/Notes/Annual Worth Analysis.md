In annual worth analysis, the cost of an investment is converted to [[Annual Payments]] over the lifetime of the investment. A is the same for repeated life cycles, all cash flows adjusted only for inflation. An investment is justified if AW $\ge$ 0 at the [[Minimum Attractive Rate of Return|MARR]].

>[!note]
>Annual worth is [[Capital Recovery]] plus A:
$$
\text{AW}=\text{CR+A}
$$

## Multiple Alternatives
With two or more alternatives, it is assumed that each alternative will be in use for at least the [[Least Common Multiple|LCM]] of lives, but it is not necessary to calculate AW at the LCM. For mutually exclusive investments, the alternative that is greatest.

## Permanent Investments
For an investment with infinite life, use the following equation:
$$
A = Pi
$$
where
- $P$ = [[Current Value|Present Worth]]
- $i$ = [[Interest and Interest Rate|Interest Rate]]
