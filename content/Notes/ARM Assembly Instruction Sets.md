ARM processors may support different [[Assembly]] instruction sets, which describe the commands the [[CPU]] can execute. 

## Thumb
The thumb instruction set supports 16 bit instructions only and was created to increase code density and reduce file sizes. It was created for the first commercially available ARM processors (ARM7TDMI), along with ARM32.


---
## ARM32
ARM32 supports 32 bit instructions for faster execution but lower code density. 



---

## Thumb-2
Thumb 2 instructions can be 16 bit thumb or 32 bit ARM. it acts as a compromise between speed and file size. The cortex-M chips use subsets of this instruction set.

## ARM64
