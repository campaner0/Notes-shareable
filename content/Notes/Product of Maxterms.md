A product of maxterms is the dual of the [[Sum of Minterms]]. It is the same in that it is a shorthand for a [[Boolean Algebra]] expression written as [[Binary]]:
$$\begin{align*}
F&=(\bar{X}+\bar{Y}+\bar{Z})(\bar{X}+Y+\bar{Z})(X+\bar{Y}+Z)(X+Y+Z)\\
&=M_0\cdot M_2\cdot M_{5}\cdot M_7\\
&=()\\
&=\prod()
\end{align*}$$
