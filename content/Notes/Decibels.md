Decibels are a logarithmic scale used to measure the intensity of sound or power level of a signal. One decibel ($dB$) is a tenth of a bel ($B$), named in honor of [[Alexander Graham Bell]]. It is the ratio of a power (or power root) quantity and a reference, e.g. a gain. To express a ratio in decibels, use the following formula:
$$
L_P=10\log_{10}\left( \frac{P}{P_{0}}\right)\,\text{dB}
$$
where
- $P$ = measured [[Electrical Power]]
- $P_0$ = reference power

>For a power root quantity such as volts, multiply by 20 instead of 10

>The neper is used for a change in power root quantity that changes by a factor of $e$ (see [[Neper Frequency]])
