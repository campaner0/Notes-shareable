In circular motion, direction is constantly changing, so velocity is constantly changing. In uniform circular motion, the path of rotation is circular and speed is constant. 

Every laspect of linear motion has an angular equivalent:

 Linear Motion | Circular Motion
 ------------- | ---------------
 [[Position]] $\vec{x}$  | [[Angle]] $\vec{\theta}$ 
 [[Velocity]] $\vec{v}$ | [[Angular Velocity]] $\vec{\omega}$
 [[Acceleration]] $\vec{a}$ | [[Angular Acceleration]] $\vec{\alpha}$
 [[Mass]] $m$ | [[Moment of Inertia]] $I$
 [[Force]] $\vec{F}$ | [[Torque]] $\vec{\tau}$
 [[Momentum]] $\vec{p}$ | [[Angular Momentum]] $\vec{L}$

Formulas for and relating to [[Energy]] ([[Electrical Power]], [[Work]]) are similar and often simply trade linear variables for their angular equivalents. Angle, angular velocity, and angular acceleration retain the differential relationship of their linear counterparts as well.

### Centripetal Force
As stated, for motion to be circular, an object's velocity must be constantly changing such that it moves in a cicular path. This is only possible if the object's linear acceleration is toward the center of its circular path. This is given by:
$$
a_c=\frac{v^2}r=r\omega^2
$$where
- $a_c$ = centripetal acceleration
- $v$ = velocity
- $r$ = radius of circular path
- $\omega$ = angular velocity

Combining with [[Newton's Second Law]] gives the centripetal force:
$$
\vec{F_c}=m\frac{v^2}r=mr\omega^2
$$
where
- $\vec{F_c}$ = the inward force on a rotating object

### Tangential Acceleration & Velocity
The distance $s$ traveled along an arc with a radius $r$ is given by $s=r\theta$, where theta is the angle swept out. Therefore:
$$
v=r\omega
$$
since velocity is the derivative of position, and angular velocity the derivative of angle. Differentialting again gives the formula for tangential acceleration:
$$
a_t=r\alpha
$$
