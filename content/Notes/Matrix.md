A matrix is an array or table of numbers or expressions that represents a [[Linear Function]]. It is the basis of Linear Algebra, and they allow computations to be easily performed on the functions they represent. These [[Matrix Operations|Operations]] are expressed using matrices, either by operating on a single matrix or by operating on one matrix with another. 

A matrix may be simplified to its [[Echelon Form]] or [[Row Reduced Echelon Form]], in which the elements of the matrix are the solutions to the linear function or system the matrix represents. This is achieved using [[Elementary Row Operations]].
