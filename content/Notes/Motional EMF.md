Motional emf is the [[Voltage]] induced in a moving conductor with a [[Time]] varying surface area in a static magnetic field. This is described by:
$$
V_{emf}^m=V_{12}=\int_{P_2}^{P_1}(\vec{u}\times\vec{B})\cdot d\vec{l}
$$
where
- $\vec u$ = [[Velocity]] of conductor
- $\vec B$ = [[Magnetic Field]]
- $\vec l$ = length vector on conductor

The cross product in this integral comes from the force calculation for a charge moving through a magnetic field ([[Electromagnetic Force#Magnetic Force on a Particle|Magnetic Force on a Particle]])
