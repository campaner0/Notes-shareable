  #Digital_Logic 

In [[Boolean Algebra]], a function in sum of products form is arranged such that the variables in each term are are only multiplied and each term is summed:
$$
F=ABC+\bar{A}BC+\cdots+\bar{A}\bar{B}\bar{C}
$$
The terms may have two or more variables, and there is no limit to the number of terms or variables.

Not to be confused with a [[Product of Sums]]
