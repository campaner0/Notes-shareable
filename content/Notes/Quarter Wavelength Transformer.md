A quarter wavelength transformer is a type of [[Impedance Matching Network]] used for impedance matching with [[Transmission Lines]]. The "transformer" is another transmission line that is a quarter, or some integer multiple of a quarter, wavelength long:
$$
l=\frac{\lambda}{4}+ \frac{n\lambda}{2}
$$
where
- $l$ = length of transformer
- $\lambda$ = [[Wavelength]] of signal traveling along lines
- $n\in\mathbb{Z}$
