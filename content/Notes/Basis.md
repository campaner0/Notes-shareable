In linear algebra, a set of [[Vector|Vectors]] $B=\{b_1,b_2,\cdots,b_p\}$ in a [[Vector Space]] $V$ is the basis for $V$ if 

1. $B$ is [[Linear Independence|Linearly Independent]] 
2. $V=\text{Span}\{b_1,b_2,\cdots,b_p\}$

If $B$ is the basis of $V$, then 
1. Any set in $V$ with more than $p$ vectors is linearly independent
2. Every other basis of $V$ must contain $p$ vectors
