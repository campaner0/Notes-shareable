[[Ethics|Ethical]] theories are used to determine the most ethical decision consistently. They are the current best thinking on how to act most ethically. Some of the most common theories:

1. [[Utilitarianism]] - the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few
2. [[Duty Ethics]] - one must perform their duty even if does not lead to most good
3. [[Rights Ethics]] - violating one's moral rights is ethically unacceptable 
4. [[Virtue Ethics]] - determine right/wrong actions based on if they support virtues/vices

Though these theories may conflict, all must be used to come to the best possible moral decision.
