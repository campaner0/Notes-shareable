Drift velocity is the average velocity of [[Electron|Electrons]] in a material.
$$\begin{align*}
v&=  \mu E\\
&= \frac{L}{t}
\end{align*}$$
where
- $\mu$ = [[Charge Carrier Mobility]]
- $E$ = [[Electric Field]] 
- $L$ = net length traveled
- $t$ = [[Time]] 

in metals, the charge carriers are e-. in semiconductors, holes and e- carry charge
