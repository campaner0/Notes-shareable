A logarithm is a sort of anti-[[Exponent]]. A base $b$ log of a number $a$ will result in the power $c$ to which $b$ must be raised to equal $a$:
$$
\log_ba=c
$$

## The log Scale
A logarithmic scale may be used when graphing to make a [[Polynomial]] curve appear linear. This aids in extrapolation and analysis. Due to the properties of the log, when applied to the polynomial $y=mx^2$, the result is linear:
$$
\log y=2\log x+\log m
$$
