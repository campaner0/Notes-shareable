  #Chemistry 

Atomic weight is the average weighted sum of all its naturally occurring isotopes. Therefore:
$$
M=m_1a_1+m_2a_2+\cdots+m_na_n
$$
where 
- $M$ = atomic mass
- $m_n$ = [[Mass]] of nth isotope
- $a_n$ = % abundance of nth isotope

>[!note]
>Since each % abundance is a percentage, the abundance fractions will sum to 1, That is,
>$$
a_{1} + a_{2} + \cdots + a_{n} = 1
$$

If a substance has atomic mass $M$, then that substance will have a mass of $M$ grams per [[Mole]]:
$$
M=\frac{6.022\times 10^{23}}{1\text{g}}
$$

### Weight/Mass and Atomic Fractions
The mass (or weight) fraction of a substance is the ratio of the mass of the substance to the total mass of the mixture: 
$$
w_i=\frac{m_i}{m_{total}}
$$
where
- $m_i$ = mass of substance $i$

The atomic fraction (or atomic ratio) is similar, substituting number of atoms:
$$
n_i=\frac{N_i}{N_{total}}
$$
where
- $N_i$ = number of atoms of element $i$

The sum of mass or atomic fractions is equal to 1:
$$
\sum\limits^n_{i=1}n_i=\sum\limits^n_{i=1}w_i=1
$$

>[!note]
>These quantities may be expressed as percentages by multiplying the fraction by 100.
>
>When the ratio is between two substances of interest instead of one substance to the whole, these are called the mass or atomic *ratio*

Atomic and weight fractions can be related through atomic mass:
$$\begin{align*}
n_{A}&= \frac{\frac{w_A}{M_{A}}}{\frac{w_A}{M_{A}}+\frac{w_B}{M_{B}}}\\[5pt]
w_{A}&= \frac{M_An_A}{M_An_A+M_Bn_{B}}
\end{align*}$$
where
- $M_A$ = atomic mass of element A
