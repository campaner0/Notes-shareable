The elementary row operations are the most basic operations that can be performed on a [[Matrix]] to reduce it or otherwise transform it. The operations are:
1. Row Addition (adding the elements of two rows)
2. Row Multiplication (multiplying a row by a scalar)
3. Row Switching (switching the position of two rows in a matrix)
