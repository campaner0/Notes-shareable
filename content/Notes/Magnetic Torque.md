Given a rectangular current loop in a uniform [[Magnetic Field]], when a current is applied, the magnetic [[Torque]] is the [[Cross Product]] of the magnetic moment [[Vector]] and B field:
$$
\vec{T}=\vec{m}\times\vec{B}
$$
where
$$
\vec{m}=NIA\hat{n}
$$
where
- $N$ = number of turns of loop
- $I$ = [[Current]]
- $A$ = [[Area]] of loop
- $\hat{n}$ = [[Normal Vector]] to plane of loop


Using the rules of the cross product, the torque be written as:
$$
|T|=NIA\sin\theta
$$
where
- $\theta$ = [[Angle]] loop is inclined relative to B field
