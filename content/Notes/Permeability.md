Not to be confused with electric [[Permittivity]], the permeability of a material is a measure of the magnetization produced in the material due to the application of a [[Magnetic Field]]. It is the proportionality constant that relates the $\vec B$ and $\vec H$ fields when they are directly proportional:
$$
\mu = \frac{\vec{B}}{\vec{H}}
$$

The permeability of a certain point in space is the product of the relative permeability of the medium at that point and vacuum permeability:
$$
\mu=\mu_r\mu_0
$$
where
- $\mu_0=4\pi\times10^{-6}\,\text{H/m}$
- $\mu_{r} = 1+\chi_v$

Relative permeability is defined using the [[Magnetic Susceptibility]] $\chi_v$ of the medium.
