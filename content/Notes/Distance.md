The Euclidean distance between two points is defined as the length of a straight line that connects the two points. On a plane, the distance between two points is given by:
$$
d=\sqrt{(\Delta x)^2+(\Delta y)^2}
$$
where
- $\Delta x$ = change in $x$, or the [[Subtraction|Difference]] of the x coordinates of each point

This equation can be generalized to higher dimension Euclidean spaces.
