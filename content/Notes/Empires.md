Currently unpopular, no one wants to be called "Imperialist"

-   Influence

    -   Language

    -   Political institutions

    -   Culture

-   Definition

    -   Supreme, extensive dominion

    -   Singular ruler over different cultures

-   Not necessarily

    -   Large

    -   Autocratic

    -   Formed by conquest - marriage

-   Assumptions

    -   They don’t work - most successful form of gov, lasted the longest

    -   Exploitive - compared to what?

-   First empire - Sargon of Akkad 2340-2284 BCE

-   Cyrus - Achaemenid Empire 559-530 BCE

    -   Claims to have interests of population in mind when ruling

    -   Empires claim to bring peace, culture to those that lack it

-   Division of history into good and bad guys

    -   Not that simple
