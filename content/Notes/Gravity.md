  #Physics 

One of [[The Four Fundamental Interactions]], gravity is the phenomenon in which all things with [[Mass]] or [[Energy]] experience an attraction to each other. While [[Special Relativity]] provides the most accurate description, Newton's law of gravity is used in most cases. 

#### Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation
This law states that the [[Force]] one object experiences due to the gravitational pull of another is equal to the ratio of the product of the two object's masses and the square of the distance between them, multiplied by a constant:
$$
\vec{F_{ab}}=-G\frac {m_am_b}{r_{ab}^2}\hat{r}
$$
where
- $G$ = gravitational constant ($6.674\times 10^{11}$$Nm^2/kg^2$)
- $m$ = [[Mass]] of each object
- $r$ = [[Distance]] between objects
- $\hat r$ = unit [[Vector]] in direction of the shortest path between the centers of the objects

The magnitude of the gravitational force is given by: $F={Gm_am_b\over r^2}$

#### Acceleration Due to Gravity
The [[Acceleration]] due to gravity an object ($b$) experiences due to a more massive object   ($a$) is found using [[Newton's Second Law]]: 
$$\begin{align*}
m_ba&={Gm_am_b\over r^2}\\
\therefore  a&=\frac{Gm_a}{r^2}\\
\end{align*}$$
where
- $a$ = acceleration of object toward the earth

Using this formula, the acceleration due to gravity of Earth can be calculated. The result is $g\approx9.81$ $m/s^2$.
