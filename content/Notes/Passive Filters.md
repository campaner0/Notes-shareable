  #Circuit_Analysis 

A passive [[Filters|Filter]] attenuates unwanted frequencies using passive circuit elements, but cannot amplify the passband, unlike [[Active Filters]]. The four most common types are [[Low-Pass Filter|Low-Pass]], [[High-Pass Filter|High-Pass]], [[Bandpass Filter|Bandpass]], and [[Bandstop Filter|Bandstop]]. 

### Corner Frequency
The line between the pass and stopbands is the corner or break [[Frequency]], which is commonly set at -3[[Decibels|dB]], or the maximum [[Voltage]] magnitude divided by $\sqrt{2}$. It is also called the half power frequency since the power is half of maximum.
