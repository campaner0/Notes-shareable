Reactance is the non-resistive opposition to [[Alternating Current|AC]] current flow presented by the inductance and capacitance of circuit elements. Unlike resistance, energy is stored then released by the circuit element after a quarter cycle instead of being dissipated as heat. Therefore, reactance is responsible for the phase change effect of inductive and capacitive circuit elements. The total reactance of a circuit is the sum of the total inductive and capacitive reactances present:
$$
X = X_L+X_C
$$

### Capacitive Reactance

$$
X_{C} = -\frac{1}{\omega C}
$$
where
- $\omega$ = [[Angular Velocity|Angular Frequency]]
- $C$ = [[Capacitance]]

### Inductive Reactance

$$
X_{L} = \omega L
$$
where
- $L$ = [[Inductance]]

### Resonance
