A [[Vector]] space (or linear space) is a non-empty set $V$ of vectors on which are defined vector addition and scalar multiplication. Along with these two operations, the space must satisfy the following eight axioms:

1. [[Associativity]]
2. [[Commutativity]]
3. [[Identity Element]] of vector addition and scalar multiplication
4. [[Inverse Element]]
5. Compatability of scalar multiplication with field multiplication
6. [[Distributivity]] with respect to vector addition
7. Distributivity with respect to field addition
