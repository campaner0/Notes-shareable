A command line interface, or CLI, is an way of interfacing with a computer using just the keyboard, as opposed to clicking on icons and buttons as in a [[Graphical User Interface]]. This can be faster and/or easier in certain circumstances. Tasks are accomplished by typing in commands (see [[Common CLI Commands]]).
