In Newtonian mechanics, the normal force is a [[Force]] perpendicular to the ground that keeps an object from sinking into it due to [[Gravity]]. More generally, it's the force that opposes the [[Acceleration]] of two objects into each other. 

Normal in this case means perpendicular, and the force will always be perpendicular to the plane where two objects meet. For an object on an inclined plane:
$$
|\vec{N}|=mg\cos\theta
$$
where
- $\vec{N}$ = normal force
- $m$ = [[Mass]]
- $\vec{g}$ = acceleration due to gravity
- $\theta$ = angle of slope

Notably, the normal force is a [[Contact Force]] (along with [[Friction]]) that only exists when two objects meet.
