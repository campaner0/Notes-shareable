A photodiode is a type of [[P-N Junction Diode]] that is used to detect light or generate electricity from light (solar cells). It is used in reverse bias, which causes the depletion region to widen. Photons then break covalent bonds and cause electrons to break free, which generates [[Current]] motivated by the [[Electric Field]] of the depletion region.
