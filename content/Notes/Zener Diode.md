The Zener diode is a type of [[P-N Junction Diode]] which 

These diodes are used in reverse bias or in the reverse breakdown region. They may be used to protect circuits from [[Voltage]]/[[Current]] spikes. If the current becomes large such that the diode is in its reverse breakdown region, the excess current flows through the Zener diode to protect the other elements. 

Under reverse bias:

Ideal|Constsant Voltage Drop|Piecewise Linear
----|----|----
Open|Source of $V_{bi}$|Source of $V_{bi}$ and resistor of $R_z$
