A cyclotron is a type of particle accelerator. Charge enters [[Magnetic Field]], begins [[Circular Motion]] with increasing [[Velocity]] (and by extension radius) and period:
$$
T=\frac{2\pi m}{qB}
$$
from radius equation: $v=\frac{qBr}{m}$ therefore:
$$
T=\frac{2\pi{r}}{v}
$$
Particle exits device when radius exceeds mag field
