Angle modulation, as opposed to [[Amplitude Modulation|AM]], is the varying of the [[Phase Angle|Phase]] of a signal to communicate info. 

Frequency and phase have a differential relationship, so frequency modulation can be achieved by changing the phase:
![[Frequency#^90a402]]
where
- $f$ = [[Frequency]]
- $\theta$ = [[Phase Angle|Phase]]
- $t$ = [[Time]]
