The propagation constant of a [[Transmission Lines|Transmission Line]] is a complex valued constant that describes how a travelling wave's amplitude and [[Phase Angle|Phase]] change as it travels along the line. It is defined as:
$$
\gamma=\alpha+j\beta
$$
where
- $\gamma$ = propagation constant
- $\alpha$ = [[Attenuation]] constant
- $\beta$ = [[Phase Constant]]

In the [[Lumped Element Model]], the attenuation and phase constants are the real and imaginary parts of the propagation constant:
$$\begin{align*}
\alpha&= \mathfrak{Re}(\sqrt{(R'+j\omega L')(G'+j\omega C')})\\
\beta&= \mathfrak{Im}(\sqrt{(R'+j\omega L')(G'+j\omega C')})
\end{align*}$$
