fringe field - magnetic field that exists outside magnetic material

soft vs hard magnetic materials
- easier vs harder to magnetize
- soft
	- easier
	- high initial permeability, low coercivity
	- less energy to (de)magnetize
	- used for alternating mag field
- hard
	- harder
	- high remanence
	- higher saturation flux density
	- low initial permeability, high coercivity

magnetization process
1. magnetic field applied
2. domain with closest alignment grows until overtakes others
	- one domain grows while others shrink
		- domain wall moves
1. domain aligns with field 


## Temperature Dependence
in ferromagnetics:
higher temperature = more lattice vibration = more misalignment in spin magnetic moments
- Curie temp = where all magnetism lost
