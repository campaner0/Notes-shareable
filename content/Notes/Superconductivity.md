first observed in 1911 by Onnes

superconductive materials
- perfectly diamagnetic substance
	- $\chi_m=-1$ 
	- resistivity drops to zero at certain temp $T_c$
		- no residual resistivity unlike others
- Meisner effect
	- under $T_c$ surface currents produced to repel applied mag field
	- reason for mags floating above superconductors
	- $T_c$ lowers under mag field
		- therefore supercon state limited by temp and mag field
- type 1
	- hard line between normal, supercon state
- type 2
	- vortex state between normal and supercon
		- mostly supercon, tiny votexes that allow mag field lines through
- cuprate superconductors
	- include copper oxide
