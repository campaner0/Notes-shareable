- tungsten filament heated, emits e- via thermionic emission
	- e- accelerated w/ [[Electric Field]] (20-60kV)
- high energy e- directed toward metal (anode)
- e- penetrate atoms of metal (usually copper), chance to knock off core e-
	- if L lvl e- falls to fill spot, emits $K_\alpha$ X-ray
	- if M, $K_\beta$
	- if N, $K_\gamma$ 
- e- that fill holes left by e- that fill core spot (and so on) also emit in X-ray spectrum
- metal foils used to filter out $K_\alpha$ for use
