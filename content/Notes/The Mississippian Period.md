The Mississippian period in the southern and midwestern states was an era of American history in which many complex pre-Columbian societies developed. This period lasted from around A.D. 800 - 1600. 

## Food and Housing
Mississippian peoples were horticulturists, meaning they grew most of their food in gardens. They grew [[The Three Sisters]], sunflowers, goosefoot, sumpweed, and others. Wild plants were also gathered, and they hunted deer, turkeys, and small game as well as fishing and gathering turtles and shellfish. 

Houses were rectangular or circular pole structures with thatched roofs and walls of saplings and/or cane woven around the poles. The outer walls were sometimes covered in sunbaked mud or daub. They were were usually 12 - 30 feet on a side, with a hole in the top for smoke to escape. Inside, low benches along the walls were used for storage and sleeping in colder months.

## Society
In Mississippian society, people were divided into elites and commoners under a chiefdom. Elites had a higher social standing and were exempt from most labor. They had larger houses, wore special clothing, and ate different food than the commoners. This division was based on religious and ideological beliefs about the elites rather than military power or wealth.

## Settlements
As farming was the main source of food, many Mississippian people lived close to rivers as the periodic flooding would keep the soil fertile. Most lived in small villages or family farms scattered across an area. 

A typical village would have a main plaza surrounded by a residential area which may have smaller courtyards throughout. There may also be a palisade with a ditch or other defensive structures. 

Certain towns featured mounds with a flat top which served as a platform for buildings or a stage. Many mounds also served as cemeteries for chiefs. A town with multiple mounds would be the capitol of a chiefdom.

## Art
Gorgets, cups, pendants, beads, blades, pipes, effigy celts and eccentricities are all examples of finely crafted objects made by Mississippian people. These were often made of shells, but also of stone and copper. This copper was not smelted, but hammered cold into sheets and engraved/cut from there. Many of these objects were used in ceremonies and rituals to represent supernatural and mythical beings, objects, and events.

## In Georgia
In Georgia, the Mississippian period is divided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods. Chiefdoms were first present in the early period (800 - 1100), and the largest occurred in the middle period (1100 - 1350). The largest chiefdom had its capital at the Etowah site in northwestern Georgia. In the late period (1350 - 1600), the largest chiefdoms had broken up into smaller ones scattered across the river valleys. 

[[Hernando de Soto]] traveled through the southeast at this time and described chiefs ruling over large territories. These were Paramount Chiefdoms, or confederacies individual chiefdoms. As more Europeans arrived, disease and the trade of native slaves and deer skins caused social upheaval and the end of the chiefdoms and Mississippian period. People scattered across the region, and populations came together to form the well-known groups of [[Creek]], [[Cherokee]], and [[Seminole]].
