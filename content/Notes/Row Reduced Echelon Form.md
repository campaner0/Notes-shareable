A [[Matrix]] is in row reduced echelon form when it satisfies the requirements for [[Echelon Form]] and:
1. The leading entries in each non-zero row are 1
2. The leading 1's are the only non-zero entry in their column

>[!example]
$$
\begin{bmatrix}1&0&-1&1\over2 \\ 0&1&1&0 \\ 0&0&0&0\end{bmatrix}
$$
