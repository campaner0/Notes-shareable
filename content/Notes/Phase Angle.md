In time domain the phase shift between two waves is the time difference between the same point on the waves divided by the period
$$
\phi =\frac{\Delta t}{T}360\degree
$$
where:
- $\phi$ = angle between vectors
- $\Delta t$ = time difference
- $T$ = period

When two functions are in phase, they peak and are at 0 at the same time.
