1. start from load impedance on smith chart
2. add cap or inductor to move to 1 (center)
adding inductor goes up
- along R circles if series
- along G circles if shunt
cap goes down (series/parallel same)
3. calculate reactance based on distance moved on chart
ex. moving on G circles from -0.69 to 0.7 = 0.69 + 0.7 = 1.19
X = $1/\Delta B$ times line impedance (usually 50ohm)
4. calculate L and/or C from reactances
