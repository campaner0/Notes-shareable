Hernando de Soto was born in Extremadura, Spain around 1500. He participated in the conquest of Panama, Nicaragua, and the Incas in Peru. During the latter, he became extremally rich. He returned to Spain to seek the title of Marquis (the status of conquistador Francisco Pizarro), and was granted permission by Charles V to explore and conquer La Florida.
