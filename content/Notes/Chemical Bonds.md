A chemical bond is the lasting attraction between two [[Atomic Theory|Atoms]] which allows the formation of molecules. The bond may be a primary (strong) bond, or a secondary (weak) bond. There is no clear line between different types of bonds, so a bond may have certain characteristics of multiple types of bonds. 

## Primary Bonds
The three types of primary bonds are [[Covalent Bonds|Covalent]], Ionic, and Metallic. These are *intra*molecular forces and therefore involve the sharing or transfer of valence [[Electron|Electrons]] between involved atoms and rely on the attraction between nuclei and their electrons. How covalent or ionic a bond is depends on how much the electrons are shared between the atoms, which in turn depends on the [[Electronegativity]] of the atoms. This is expressed in percent ionic character:
$$
\text{\%IC}=\{1-\exp[-(0.25)(X_A-X_{B})^{2}]\}\times 100
$$
where
- $X_A$ = electronegativity of element A

- metallic
	- low electroneg = valence e- form sea around atoms
	- e- cloud fills space and attracts ions through coulombic attraction

## Secondary Bonds


weak/secondary
- hydrogen bonds
- van der walls forces
	- result of polar molecule interaction
- London dispersion

mixed
- many materials bond with a mixture of two or more bonds
- bond tetrahedron


Process:
1. atoms come within close proximity (nm)
2. attractive forces bring together
3. repulsive forces start to repel
4. atoms settle in balance where force is 0

$$\begin{align*}
E&= E_A+E_R\\
&= -\frac{A}{r^{n}}+\frac{B}{r^{m}}
\end{align*}$$
where
- $A, B, n, m$ = constants depending on elements

$E_0$ is the bond/binding energy
- larger means higher melting point, strength

ionic bond energy = $E_0$ + electron affinity of negative ion - ionization energy of positive ion

nonionic leaves out $E_0$
