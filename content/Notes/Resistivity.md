$$
\rho = \rho_{T}+\rho_{I}
$$

due to thermal vibrations
$$
\rho_{T}= \frac{m_{e}T}{q^{2}nC}
$$
where
- $m_e$ = [[Mass]] of an [[Electron]] 
- $T$ = [[Temperature]]
- $q$ = elementary [[Charge]]
- $n$ = charge carrier concentration
- $C$ = Nordheim coefficient 

due to impurities
$$
\rho_{I}= CX(1-X)
$$
where
- $X$ = atomic fraction of impurity atoms

>[!note]
>For an alloy, the resistivity is:

\rho=\rho_{matrix}+\rho_{I}
$$
>where $\rho_{matrix}$ is the resistivity of the majority element
