Voltage regulation (VR) is a quantity that describes how much the [[Voltage]] across the output of an electric machine ([[Transformer]], [[Induction Generator]]) changes under load. It is used to compare the efficiencies of the machines. Voltage regulation is given by:
$$
VR= \frac{V_{nl}-V_{fl}}{V_{fl}}\times100\%
$$
where
- $V_{nl}$ = voltage with no load
- $V_{fl}$ = voltage at full load
