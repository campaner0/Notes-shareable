- Also known as a Wein Filter. 
- Two parallel plates of opposite charge create electromagnetic field between them
- Particles not at a certain [[Velocity]] when entering are deflected. Total [[Force]] on charge is sum of electric and magnetic force ([[Electromagnetic Force]]):
$$
\vec{F}=\vec{F_e}+\vec{F_B}
$$
These are in opposite directions, so if not equal will affect direction of charge's motion

The [[Charge]] will continue with inital velocity if $qvB=qE$, therfore
$$
v=\frac{E}{B}
$$
where $v$ is the velocity being selected for
